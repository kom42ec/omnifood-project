# Omnifood Project

Omnifood is a food app that uses AI to create and deliver custom healthy meal plans. The goal is to design and build a landing page for the service. This is the final project from the Udemy course ["Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Here I am not gonna follow the course and build the exact same website as the instructor. I will come up with my own design and try to build it with the skills I currently posess.

## What I learned

1. Trick to add a border inside a button element without using the border property:

```
.btn {
   box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 3px #fff; }
 }
```

2. How to apply the same grayish color to different logo images without Photoshop.

```
.logos img {
    filter: brightness(0); /* Make logos completely black */
    opacity: 50%; /* Make logos translucent so they appear grayish */
}
```
