# Omnifood Project

Omnifood is a food app that uses AI to create and deliver custom healthy meal plans. The goal is to design and build a landing page for the service. This is the final project from the Udemy course ["Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Here I am not gonna follow the course and build the exact same website as the instructor. I will come up with my own design and try to build it with the skills I currently posess.
